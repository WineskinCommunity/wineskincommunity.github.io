[Wineskin Community](https://github.com/WineskinCommunity/Wineskin) is an ideally temporary fork of [Wineskin](http://wineskin.urgesoftware.com/tiki-index.php) with the intention of modernizing the development workflow and making it easier for new developers to join and maintain the code together. 

[Continuous integration](https://travis-ci.org/WineskinCommunity/Wineskin) will be used to automate the build and release process. This will help end users get faster access to bug fixes and new features, and reduce the friction on developers for drafting new releases.

Following the success of the [Moya contributor guidelines](https://github.com/Moya/contributors/blob/0d5e80682b2377bdca72585eda9ce83467bee3c4/README.md), new contributors will be granted commit access early and often. To maintain code quality, merging code into the master branch will need to pass continuous integration checks and require code review from at least one other project member.
